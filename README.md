## Description

_This application allows a user to log foods they've eaten, along with a description of the foods and # of calories in the foods. The user can also filter by high (above 500) and low (500 and below) calorie foods._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone cafrinko's GitHub Meal-Tracker-App repository
* Install node packages and dependencies for the Angular2 environment using the following commands:
  * npm install
  * bower install
  Install globals if needed
    * npm install gulp -g
    * npm install bower -g
    * gem install sass
    * npm install typescript -g
    * apm install atom-typescript
  * gulp build
  * gulp serve
* Anytime after editing the code, run gulp build, then gulp serve. Even though gulp build will run anytime you run gulp serve, run gulp build anyway from the perspective of healthy skepticism.
